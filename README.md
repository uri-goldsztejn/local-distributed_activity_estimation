## Overview



## Files

* *tensor_decomposition* - Implements the tensor decomposition described in our work.
* *utils/* - auxiliary functions.
* *example/* - data and usage examles.

## Software requirements

This tensor decomposition requires the following submodules, which are copied in this repository for ease of use.
* The Tensor toolbox, which can be downloaded from: [tensortoolbox.org](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/)
* ckronx: An efficient computation of Kronecker products (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74107-ckronx-efficient-computation-with-kronecker-products), MATLAB Central File Exchange.
